# My minimalistic vim configuration

This is my personal vimrc, which primarily focuses on the following goals:

1. speed
2. readability
3. minimalism (avoid unnecessary configurations and plugins)

### Caution

For some custom shortcuts to work properly in some terminals, add the following configuration in .bashrc

```bash
stty -ixon
```
