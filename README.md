# My minimalistic vim configuration

This is my personal vimrc, which primarily focuses on the following goals:

1. speed
2. readability
3. minimalism (avoid unnecessary configurations and plugins)

The color scheme I'm using is "solarized", which I think is the best for readability.

### Caution

For a few custom shortcuts to work properly in some terminals, add the following configuration in .bashrc

```bash
stty -ixon
```
